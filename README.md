# Buildfest2025 Documentation

Welcome! This is the TXI Social Impact Buildfest 2025 repo for team Axos. In this buildfest, we use Datafeel's Dot technology to support the UT Bateman team's #HoldUpTheHalf Campaign by creating a product that promotes library advocacy.

In this document, you'll find

- Product user guidelines
- Our creation process

# Project overview

Our project addresses censorship by tackling the gap between the decision-makers pushing for book bans and the students who are impacted by these decisions.

Our product: A combination of annotation software and responsive chair will convert written annotations on a passage to a haptic playback track, enabling readers to experience other peopleâ€™s reactions to material in a multi-sensorial experience. By creating emotional and personal connections over controversial topics in banned books, we will bridge differences and promote empathy in a novel experience that underscores the importance of access to diverse literature. Our product will become a library exhibit dedicated to censorship that allows students to share why banned content is important to them, fostering empathy and support to keep these books available.

1. Annotation: Use colored highlighting and text notes leave responses to text

_Markup text with highlighting and comments_


2. Association: Software uses sentiment analysis to convert the combination of text and markup into a haptic feedback track
Nothing need be done by the user here!

3. Activation: Future participants select from and play back the haptic response as the poem is read

_Play back the poem and haptic response. Read aloud provides access for vision-impaired participants and auditory learners_

# Our Creation Process

**Pre-build research**
Before the build starts, we conduct research on library advocacy and social issues, creating a research document, reading online, and even speaking to librarians at the Austin Public Library.

**Friday: Team formation, brainstorming, and the beginnings**
A group of three and a group of two meet and combine! We learn about Datafeel tech, brain dump possible solutions, and present a "Wellness lab" idea during the gallery walk, sharing features meant to calm busy adults working in the ilbrary. Halfway through the presentation (and before we even get to feedback), we realize we don't like it. We spend the rest of the night spitballing ideas, converging on a desire for personal connection which feels all too lacking in this day and age. Additional feedback leads us to hone in on the ability for users to not only experience but also create haptic experiences, and we land on an annotation tool before heading out for the night. Meanwhile, our tech guru Cammi is starting on the basics on input and output to the Datafeel Dots.

**Saturday: Build, build, build!**
Now that we have an idea, we dive into the mechanics of how it will work. Helen, Anooshka, and Maddie research connections between color, sound, temperature, and emotion, and Alana maps out a plan for linking sentiment parameters like valence, dominance, and arousal to vibration, color, and temperature. Cammi continues to code.

Once that's mapped out, we split into working on slides and prototypes. We decide a chair would create a comfortable and engaging experience while encouraging interaction with libraries as a third space; this would especially enhance the objective of promoting discussion and thought. We begin work on designs, where to put the dots, and how to construct it.

However, in making our presentation, we realize we need to hone in on our topic even more. How would this annotation technology be implemented to help libraries on a specific topic? After additional group discussion, we have our answer: the power of saving and sharing emotions through immersive haptic feedback could serve as a powerful tool to communicate the importance of literature on lives. By providing a platform for sharing the impact of books with less affected popualations like working adults, we can support library advocacy by creating cross-generational connections and empowering students to fight against book bans.

With a clear vision, we dive fully into our prototype and final presentation resources. As we create the prototype, we make small adjustments to accomodate the limitations of the dots, including moving them around to stay with our prototype. With one neck, one front, and two wrist dots, the code continuing to code, and the website UI designed, our project comes together, piece by piece.
